\f0\fs24 \cf0 The event_manager.rb file located in the lib folder is main file for the application. You must run that file to see any results. The other files are refactored class files that I separated out from the event_manager.rb file.\

Sorry for having it in separate files. I know you wanted it in a single .rb file, but I had already refactored out some of the classes and didn't want to break the app by trying to undo it. Plus it was an extra learning experience refactoring classes :).}
